Traffic Flow Analysis Using YOLO Model 🚦
Welcome to the Traffic Flow Analysis project, designed to analyze domestic traffic patterns effectively using state-of-the-art object detection technology! This system provides real-time insights into vehicle types and counts, empowering smarter traffic management and optimization.

🔍 Key Features
YOLO Model for Detection:

Trained to detect and classify 15 different types of vehicles.
Achieved an impressive 89% accuracy in vehicle detection.
Interactive Analytics Dashboard:

Built with React for a user-friendly experience.
Displays key traffic insights, including:
Total Vehicle Classes Detected.
Count of Each Vehicle Type.
Traffic Optimization:

Insights generated by the model can be used to:
Improve traffic management systems.
Reduce road congestion.
Enhance road safety measures.
Scalable Deployment:

Ready for integration into smart city infrastructure.
Scalable to monitor larger road networks in real time.
🚀 Technologies Used
Model: YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection.
Frontend: React for dashboard development.
Backend: Python and Flask (or relevant framework) to manage traffic data.
Data Analysis: Pandas and Matplotlib for generating traffic insights.
